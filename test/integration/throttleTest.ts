/**
 * We used to have a test here that tested whether Mjolnir was going to carry out a redact order the default limits in a reasonable time scale.
 * Now I think that's never going to happen without writing a new algorithm for respecting rate limiting.
 * Which is not something there is time for.
 *
 * https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/13018
 *
 * Synapse rate limits were broken and very permitting so that's why the current hack worked so well.
 * Now it is not broken, so our rate limit handling is.
 *
 * https://github.com/matrix-org/mjolnir/commit/b850e4554c6cbc9456e23ab1a92ede547d044241
 *
 * Honestly I don't think we can expect anyone to be able to use Mjolnir under default rate limits.
